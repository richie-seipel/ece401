### ECE 401 Final Project 
## Ethan First, Owen Funk, Richie Seipel 

This project includes our work benchmarking three different riscv CPU designs using the CoreMark benchmark. This repository also contains our previous work attempting to pipeline a multi-cycle riscv CPU, and evaluate the performance impact of changing the multiplier module in the multi-cycle cpu. These are unfinished but included for completeness.
